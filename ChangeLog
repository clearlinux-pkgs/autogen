	it is 2018 now

	Update release notes

	Add AC_LANG_SOURCE to AC_RUN_IFELSE
	A "new" requirement that is only a decade or so old.
	Sort .gitignore and ignore .cvsignore, too
	and also ensure -Wno-format-contains-nul gets propagated properly.
	Minimum Guile version is now 2.0

	NUL bytes are okay in format strings
	* configure.ac.pre: silence the frigging warning
