	NUL terminate CGI def text
	Usually (99.44% of the time), CGI text gets NUL teriminated.
	However, sometimes not.  Fix it.

	* agen5/autogen.c (ag_abend_at): call abort()
	* agen5/agCgi.c (ENV_TABLE) reorder to make easier to debug
	* agen5/cgi-fsm.c (cgi_run_fsm): add NUL byte on separation transition.

	Fix mal-formed usage text
	Option "values" beyond the range of single letters were supposed to
	indicate that there was no flag character for the option.  The
	"IS_GRAPHIC_CHAR()" macro did not properly test for this.

	* agen5/agUtils.c (span_quote): remove unneeded braces
	* autoopts/cook.c (nl_count): new function to clarify code
	  (contiguous_quote): clarify with new function
	* autoopts/usage.c (GRAPH_CH): new macro for testing for graphic chars.
	  Will not stumble on values beyond 0xFF.
